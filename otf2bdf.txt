OTF2BDF(1)                                             OTF2BDF(1)



NAME
       otf2bdf - OpenType to BDF font converter


SYNOPSIS
       otf2bdf [options] font.{ttf,otf}


DESCRIPTION
       otf2bdf  will convert an OpenType font to a BDF font using
       the Freetype2 renderer (http://www.freetype.org).


OPTIONS
       otf2bdf accepts the following command line arguments:



       -v      print warning messages when the font is converted.


       -n      disable glyph hinting.


       -p n    set  the  desired point size (see default value by
               running the program with the -h option).


       -et     display a list  of  the  platforms  and  encodings
               available  in  the  font. The default values, com-
               piled into  the  program,  are  a  platform  of  3
               (Microsoft)  and  encoding of 1 (ISO10646). If the
               font does not contain  the  default  platform  and
               encoding,  the fallback will be the Apple ISO10646
               encoding.


       -r n    set both the horizontal and the  vertical  resolu-
               tion  (see  default  value  by running the program
               with the -h option).  The minimum is 10dpi and the
               maximum is 1200dpi.


       -rh n   set  the  horizontal resolution (see default value
               by running the program with the -h  option).   The
               minimum is 10dpi and the maximum is 1200dpi.


       -rv n   set  the vertical resolution (see default value by
               running the program with the -h option).  The min-
               imum is 10dpi and the maximum is 1200dpi.


       -o outfile
               sets  the  output  filename  (default output is to
               stdout).


       -pid id set the platform id for  selecting  the  character
               map (see default value by running the program with
               the -h option).


       -eid id set the encoding id for  selecting  the  character
               map (see default value by running the program with
               the -h option).


       -c c    set the character spacing.  This should be one  of
               `P'  for  proportional,  `M' for monospace, or `C'
               for character cell.  By default, the spacing of  a
               font will be automatically determined to be either
               `M' or `P' according to  values  provided  in  the
               font.


       -f name set  the  foundry name used in the XLFD name.  The
               default value is `Freetype'.


       -t name set the typeface name used in the XLFD  name.   By
               default,  otf2bdf  will attempt to get a name from
               the font first and then it will use the name  sup-
               plied  with  this  command line option, and if all
               else fails, it will use the name `Unknown'.


       -w name set the weight name used in  the  XLFD  name.   If
               this  value  is not supplied, the default value is
               assumed to be `Medium'.  Some  common  values  for
               this   are   `Thin',   `Delicate',   `ExtraLight',
               `Light',  `Normal',   `Medium',   `SemiCondensed',
               `Condensed',  `SemiBold', `Bold', `Heavy', `Extra-
               Bold', and `ExtraHeavy'.


       -s name set the slant name used in the XLFD name.  If this
               value  is  not  supplied,  the  default  value  is
               assumed to be `R', for Roman.  Some common  values
               for  this  are  `R' for Roman, `I' for Italic, `O'
               for Oblique, `RI' for Reverse Italic, and `RO' for
               Reverse Oblique.


       -k name set  the  width  name  used in the XLFD name.  The
               default is `Normal'.


       -d name set the additional style name  used  in  the  XLFD
               name.  The default is an empty string.


       -u char set    the   character   used   to   replace   the
               dashes/spaces in a font name.  The default is  the
               space character.


       -l subset
               define  a  list  of  character codes which will be
               used to select a subset of glyphs from  the  font.
               The syntax of the subset string is the same as the
               syntax for selecting  subsets  in  X11  XLFD  font
               names.  Example:

               % otf2bdf -l '60 70 80_90' font.ttf -o font.bdf

               The  command  above  will only generate the glyphs
               for codes 60, 70, and  80  through  90  inclusive.
               Glyphs  that  are not in the subset are not gener-
               ated.


       -m mapfile
               specifies a mapping file which will  reencode  the
               BDF  font  when  it is generated.  Any glyphs with
               codes that do not have a mapping will not be  gen-
               erated.

               The  remapping  file  should begin with two lines,
               one which starts with  REGISTRY  followed  by  the
               character  set  registry and one which starts with
               ENCODING followed by  the  encoding.   An  example
               from the iso8859.2 file:

               REGISTRY ISO8859
               ENCODING 2

               The  remapping  data should be two columns of hex-
               adecimal numbers, separated  by  spaces  or  tabs.
               The first column should have the code which should
               be used in the BDF font.  The second column should
               be the hexadecimal code of the glyph in the "cmap"
               table otf2bdf is using.  An example  mapping  file
               is provided which will map fonts from Unicode (the
               default "cmap" table) to ISO8859-2.

               Unicode is not the only  option.   If  you  choose
               another  platform  and  encoding ID on the command
               line, then the remapping is assumed  to  map  from
               the  chosen  platform  and  encoding to some other
               character set.
